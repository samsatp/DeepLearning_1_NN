# Learning DeepLearning 1: Neural Network very basic
---
This repository is a place to practice implementing what I learn from Andrej Karpathy lectures provided by his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy

Specifically, this repository consists of implementations of basic neural network at a low level. It is entirely for educational purposes, not production level applications. I follow Andrej's lecture and implement things he has done based completely on my understanding without copying any code from anywhere (except for some test run scripts).
